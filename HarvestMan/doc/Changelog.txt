Version 1.4.5 final
Release Date: Aug 19 2005

Release Focus: Bug-fixes

Changes
=======
1. Added a subdomain flag to the command line.
2. For verbosity level of zero, no message is printed.
Earlier this used to print the welcome message.

Bug-fixes
=========
1. Fixed the bug with starting a project by reading
back an existing project file. This was not working
before. Project file written out using Python marshal
module, not pickle.
2. Fixed bugs in localization. The regular expression's
sub method should replace URL only once. Test site:
http://www.oligopolywatch.com .
3. Verbosity command line flag was not working. Fixed
it. Fixed errors with a few other command line options.
4. The stop project method of the program now
calls the "terminate" method on threads so we dont
have hanging threads.
