*==========================================================*
Version 1.4.5 b1 (beta 1)
Release Date: -------

Improvements
============
1. There is only one improvement in this release, the new
command line options. The new release has a complete set
of new command line options written from scratch. It 
replaces the previous cluttered and confusing command line.
A notable feature is that you can use HarvestMan like wget
for only downloading URLs with a nocrawl option. The new
command line supports a number of useful options which
the user is most likely to configure. It skips a number
of advanced or obscure options that the user need not
be bothered with, making the command line user friendly.

Bug-fixes
=========
Most of these are minor, except the first two.

1. Added extensions .shtm, .php4, .aspx, .cfm, .cfml,
.cms as valid web-page extensions in urlparser.py. So
web-pages ending in these extensions will work with
HarvestMan. 
2. When printing the url tree, duplicate links were not
checked. This has been fixed by adding a check.
3. A minor bug in setting verbosity in logger object
was fixed.
4. Comments will be printed for starting & stoppping
of url server at verbosity level 3. Comments for pinging
url server is raised to debug level 4 from 3.
5. Program version number, when print using the -v option
will print the release level also. For example right now
this will be printed as 'HarvestMan 1.4.5 beta 1'. Earlier
it used to print only the version number.
6. The __fix method of config.py now looks at the number
of URLs. If no URLs are found (either from config.xml or
through command line), it exits with an error message.
7. Asyncore thread for urlserver is now a daemon thread,
so it will exit if the program is killed.
8. Fixed a minor bug in set_proxy in connector.py where
the function to set proxy was being called three times.
Changed this to one.
9. Fixed a bug in rules.py. Member self._robocache should
be a list.
