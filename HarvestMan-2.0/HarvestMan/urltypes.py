# The URL types are defined as classes with easy-to-use
# string representations. However the class names are
# unlike regular HarvestMan class names (which usually start
# with 'HarvestMan'). Instead they are capitalized and start
# with TYPE_.

# Also, these classes are to be used as "raw", in other words
# ideally the clients of these classes need not create instances
# from the classes. Instead they should use them as given,
# i.e as classes.
